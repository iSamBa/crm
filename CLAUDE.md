## Architecture Overview

This is a fitness studio CRM built with Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. The application uses a role-based architecture with two authenticated user portals and member data management.

### Core Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database, realtime)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **State**: Zustand store + TanStack Query for server state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

### Role-Based Architecture

The application has two authenticated user roles with separate portals, plus member data management:

1. **Admin Portal** (`/admin/*`) - Full system access, member management, analytics, trainer oversight
2. **Trainer Portal** (`/trainer/*`) - Client management, session scheduling, progress tracking
3. **Members** - Non-authenticated data records managed by admins and accessible to trainers

### Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled through `src/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx`:
- Supabase Auth integration with role-based redirects (admin/trainer only)
- `useAuth()` hook provides user state and role helpers (`isAdmin`, `isTrainer`)
- `ProtectedRoute` component wraps pages requiring specific roles
- Home page (`/`) automatically redirects to role-appropriate dashboard

### Data Layer Architecture

**Types**: All fitness domain models are defined in `src/types/index.ts`:
- `User` (authenticated admin/trainer), `Member` (standalone record), `Trainer` (extends User)
- `Subscription`, `Payment`, `TrainingSession`, `BodyMeasurement`, `Attendance`

**State Management**:
- **Client State**: Zustand store (`src/store/index.ts`) for app-wide state
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data fetching and caching
- **Auth State**: Separate context for user authentication

**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with the following key tables:
- `users` (extends auth.users with admin/trainer profile data)
- `members` (standalone customer records), `trainers` (authenticated user extensions)
- `subscriptions`, `payments`, `training_sessions`
- `body_measurements`, `attendance`

### Layout System

Two layout components handle role-specific navigation:
- `AdminLayout` - Full sidebar with member management, trainer oversight, reports, analytics
- `TrainerLayout` - Client-focused navigation with scheduling and progress tracking tools

Both layouts use the `Sidebar` component with role-specific navigation items defined in:
- `adminNavItems`, `trainerNavItems`

### Environment Configuration

Critical environment variables (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

Future integrations prepared:
- Stripe payment processing
- SMTP email configuration

### Constants and Routes

All application constants centralized in `src/constants/index.ts`:
- User roles, membership statuses, payment methods
- Route definitions for type-safe navigation
- Status enums for subscriptions, sessions, payments

### Component Architecture

**UI Components**: shadcn/ui base components in `src/components/ui/`
**Feature Components**: Organized by domain (members, trainers, payments, etc.)
**Layout Components**: Role-specific layouts and navigation

### Development Patterns

1. **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
2. **Route Organization**: Follow Next.js App Router conventions with role-based folders
3. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with proper interface definitions
4. **Role Checks**: Always use `useAuth()` helpers for role-based logic
5. **Navigation**: Use `ROUTES` constants for type-safe routing

### Key Integration Points

- **Supabase Client**: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` (client-side)
- **Supabase Server**: `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (server-side with cookies)
- **Auth Context**: Global authentication state management
- **Query Provider**: TanStack Query setup in `src/lib/query-provider.tsx`

### Database Schema Reference

The README.md contains complete SQL schema for Supabase setup including:
- User role extensions, member/trainer specific tables
- Subscription and payment tracking
- Session scheduling and body measurement tracking
- Row Level Security (RLS) considerations

## UI Theme and Colors

The application uses a warm, energetic fitness-themed color palette:

**Primary Colors** (defined in `src/app/globals.css`):
- **Primary**: `oklch(0.65 0.22 28)` - Warm orange, used for main actions and active states
- **Accent**: `oklch(0.72 0.15 45)` - Lighter orange, for secondary elements
- **Secondary**: Standard grays for supporting elements

**Color Usage Guidelines**:
- Primary orange for active navigation, buttons, and key interactive elements
- White text (`primary-foreground`) for contrast against primary backgrounds
- Consistent hover states: `hover:bg-primary hover:text-primary-foreground`

**Interactive States**:
- Navigation links use primary color for active/hover states with white text
- Dashboard cards implement group hover pattern with icon color transitions
- All interactive elements follow the primary color scheme for consistency

## Code Quality Standards

**Before any commit**:
1. Run `npm run lint` to check code quality
2. Run `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript
3. Test with demo accounts to ensure functionality
4. Verify hover states and visual consistency work properly

**Theming Consistency**:
- Always use theme colors (primary/accent) instead of hardcoded colors
- Implement proper hover states with `group` pattern for complex components
- Ensure sufficient contrast (white text on primary background)
- Follow the established orange theme throughout new features

When implementing new features, follow the established patterns of role-based access, proper TypeScript typing, and the two-tier authentication architecture (Admin/Trainer) with member data management that runs throughout the application.

## ‚úÖ Training Session Management System Complete

**Implementation Complete**: Comprehensive training session management system with calendar interface, session scheduling, and conflict detection.

The training session management system is now fully functional and integrated into the admin portal, providing a complete solution for scheduling, managing, and tracking training sessions between members and trainers.

## ‚úÖ Architecture Change Complete: Members as Non-Authenticated Entities

**Completed**: Successfully transformed members from authenticated users to managed data records

### Implementation Summary

**‚úÖ Phase 1: Remove Member Portal**
- Deleted `/member` route and all member-facing components
- Removed MemberLayout and member navigation items
- Updated home page routing to only handle admin/trainer redirects

**‚úÖ Phase 2: Remove Member Authentication**
- Removed members from authentication system completely
- Updated User type and constants to remove member role
- Removed member demo account from setup script
- Simplified members table by removing auth-related fields

**‚úÖ Phase 3: Admin Member Management**
- Created comprehensive member CRUD interface in admin portal (`/admin/members`)
- Added member list/table view with search and filtering
- Created member profile forms for adding/editing member details
- Implemented member data operations without authentication requirements

**‚úÖ Phase 4: Database & Security Updates**
- Updated Supabase RLS policies for simplified member data access

**New Architecture**:
- **Admin & Trainer**: Authenticated users with portal access
- **Members**: Customer data records managed entirely through CRM interface
- **Two-Portal System**: Admin/Trainer authentication only, no member self-service

The app is now a traditional CRM where members are managed customer data rather than active system users. Members can be created, updated, and managed through the admin interface at `/admin/members`.
