## ‚ú® Modern Architecture Overview (2024-2025)

This fitness studio CRM is built with **Next.js 15 App Router**, **React 19**, and follows **2024-2025 best practices** for modern web application development. The application features a comprehensive modernization with TanStack Query, Server Components, React 19 compiler optimizations, and enhanced performance patterns.

### üöÄ Core Tech Stack (Modernized)

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database, realtime)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: 
  - **Server State**: TanStack Query v5 with smart caching
  - **Client State**: Zustand store for app-wide state
  - **Auth State**: React Context for authentication
- **Forms & Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod runtime validation
- **Performance**: React 19 compiler, Server Components, virtualization

### üèóÔ∏è Modern Architecture Patterns

**‚úÖ Server-First Architecture**:
- Server Components for static content and initial data loading
- Client Components only when interactivity is required
- Hybrid rendering for optimal performance

**‚úÖ Modern State Management**:
- TanStack Query v5 for server state with intelligent caching
- Enhanced BaseService pattern with optimistic updates
- Automatic cache invalidation and query key management

**‚úÖ Performance Optimizations**:
- React 19 experimental compiler for automatic memoization
- Virtualized lists for large datasets (react-window)
- Package import optimization and tree-shaking
- SWC compiler optimizations

### üîí Role-Based Architecture

The application has two authenticated user roles with separate portals:

1. **Admin Portal** (`/admin/*`) - Full system access, member management, analytics, trainer oversight
2. **Trainer Portal** (`/trainer/*`) - Client management, session scheduling, progress tracking
3. **Members** - Non-authenticated data records managed by admins and accessible to trainers

### üîê Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled through `src/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx`:
- Supabase Auth integration with role-based redirects (admin/trainer only)
- `useAuth()` hook provides user state and role helpers (`isAdmin`, `isTrainer`)
- `ProtectedRoute` component wraps pages requiring specific roles
- Home page (`/`) automatically redirects to role-appropriate dashboard

### üìä Enhanced Data Layer Architecture

**Types**: All fitness domain models are defined in `src/types/index.ts`:
- `User` (authenticated admin/trainer), `Member` (standalone record), `Trainer` (extends User)
- `Subscription`, `Payment`, `TrainingSession`, `BodyMeasurement`, `Attendance`

**Modern State Management**:
- **Server State**: TanStack Query v5 with enhanced BaseService pattern
- **Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas for runtime type safety
- **Caching**: Smart query invalidation and optimistic updates
- **Performance**: Automatic memoization through React 19 compiler

**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with the following key tables:
- `users` (extends auth.users with admin/trainer profile data)
- `members` (standalone customer records), `trainers` (authenticated user extensions)
- `subscriptions`, `payments`, `training_sessions`
- `body_measurements`, `attendance`

### üé® Component Architecture (Modernized)

**Server Components** (`src/components/dashboard/`):
- `AdminDashboardStats` - Server-rendered statistics
- `AdminDashboardActivities` - Server-rendered activity feed
- Static content components for better performance

**Client Components**:
- Interactive UI components requiring hooks or event handlers
- Form components with React Hook Form integration
- Real-time data components

**Optimized Components** (`src/components/optimized/`):
- `MemberListItem` - Memoized list item for performance
- `VirtualMemberList` - Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Performance-critical components with React.memo

### üõ†Ô∏è Modern Service Layer Pattern

**Enhanced BaseService** (`src/lib/services/base-service.ts`):
```typescript
class BaseService {
  // Modern patterns implemented:
  // - Optimistic updates with automatic rollback
  // - Smart cache invalidation
  // - Zod validation integration
  // - Error handling with ServiceResponse pattern
  // - Query key factories for consistent caching
}
```

**Service Pattern Requirements**:
- All database operations MUST go through service layer
- MUST use Zod validation for input/output
- MUST implement proper error handling
- MUST use TanStack Query for cache management
- MUST follow ServiceResponse<T> pattern

### üéØ Modern Development Patterns (MANDATORY)

1. **Server Components First**: Use Server Components unless interactivity is required
2. **TanStack Query**: Use modern hooks pattern, not useState/useEffect for server data
3. **Zod Validation**: All API inputs/outputs MUST be validated with Zod
4. **Enhanced BaseService**: All new services MUST extend BaseService
5. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with proper interface definitions
6. **Performance**: Use React.memo, virtualization for large lists
7. **Cache Management**: Implement proper query invalidation strategies

### üìã Code Quality Standards (CRITICAL)

**Before any commit**:
1. ‚úÖ Run `npm run lint` to check code quality
2. ‚úÖ Run `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript
3. ‚úÖ Test with demo accounts to ensure functionality
4. ‚úÖ Verify hover states and visual consistency work properly
5. ‚úÖ Ensure all new code follows modern patterns outlined below

**Modern Code Patterns (MANDATORY)**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Modern TanStack Query Hook
export function useMembers(filters?: MemberFilters) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: queryKeys.members.list(filters),
    queryFn: () => memberService.getMembers(filters),
    select: (data) => data.data || [],
    meta: { errorMessage: 'Failed to load members' }
  });
}

// ‚ùå INCORRECT: Old useState/useEffect Pattern
const [members, setMembers] = useState([]);
useEffect(() => {
  memberService.getMembers().then(setMembers);
}, []);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Enhanced Service with Validation
async createMember(data: CreateMemberData): Promise<ServiceResponse<Member>> {
  const validation = this.validateInput(CreateMemberSchema, data);
  if (validation.error) return { data: null, error: validation.error };
  
  return this.executeMutation(/* ... */, {
    invalidateQueries: [this.invalidate.members.all],
    optimisticUpdate: { queryKey, updater }
  });
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Server Component for Static Content
export async function AdminDashboardStats() {
  // Server-side data fetching
  return <div>{/* Static content */}</div>;
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Memoized Performance Component
export const MemberListItem = memo(function MemberListItem({
  member, onEdit, onDelete
}: MemberListItemProps) {
  // Memoized component logic
});
```

### üîß Environment Configuration

Critical environment variables (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### üé® UI Theme and Colors - Mono Theme Implementation ‚úÖ

The application uses a **professional monochrome theme** with **Geist Mono** typography:

**Monochrome Color Palette** (defined in `src/app/globals.css`):
- **Primary**: `oklch(0.2 0 0)` - Dark charcoal for primary elements in light mode
- **Background**: `oklch(0.98 0 0)` (light) / `oklch(0.08 0 0)` (dark)
- **Foreground**: `oklch(0.15 0 0)` (light) / `oklch(0.95 0 0)` (dark)
- **Chart Colors**: Graduated grayscale palette from dark to light for data visualization

**Theme Features**:
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Seamless switching with localStorage persistence
- **Monospace Typography**: Geist_Mono for consistent, professional appearance
- **Accessible Contrast**: Carefully balanced grayscale colors for optimal readability
- **Consistent Theming**: All components, charts, and status indicators use the monochrome palette

**Theme Implementation**:
- **Theme Context**: `src/lib/theme/theme-context.tsx` - System preference detection and persistence
- **Theme Toggle**: `src/components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` - Sun/moon icon toggle button
- **Color Variables**: All colors defined using OKLCH color space for modern color consistency
- **Chart Colors**: Dynamic theme-aware colors in member distribution charts and status breakdowns
